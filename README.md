# CaptureWhale

A small program to take a screenshot and immediately save it to a sequentially named file.

My son was doing a project in Minecraft and needed to image the entire scrolling list of block types. I found this frustrating with the currently available screen capture utilites as I had to take a screenshot, open it in another app to save it, switch back to Minecraft, rinse, repeat. This program saves the screenshot as a numbered filename, then the next screenshot is instantly saved with an incremented filename, etc. Easy peasy.
